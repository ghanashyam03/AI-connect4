# Connect 4 Game

## Description
Connect 4 is a classic two-player game where the objective is to be the first to connect four of one's own discs of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on the game board.

## Implementation
This project implements a Connect 4 game using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. The backend handles game logic, including player moves and AI moves, while the frontend provides a user interface for playing the game.

### Algorithm
The AI player uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine its moves. The evaluation function considers the number of connected sequences for each player on the game board.

## Stack
- Frontend:
  - React
  - JavaScript

- Backend:
  - Flask
  - Python
